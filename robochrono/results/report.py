"""Turning summaries into one comparison table — when they may be compared.

Every summary this module aggregates was produced against one dataset and one
protocol, recorded in its run's ``run.json``. Aggregation is where that
provenance either gets enforced or silently lost, so the rule lives here:
results from different dataset fingerprints are **refused**, not footnoted.
A table quietly mixing two datasets looks exactly like a table that means
something.

Two kinds of flag ride along with the scores, pointing at two different
places to go digging:

- ``fault`` (✗) — the run did not execute properly; the number in that cell is
  not a score. Go look at the framework: prompts, batching, parsing, media.
- ``floor`` (⚠) — it executed, and scored no better than a strategy that never
  watches the video. Go look at the model, or at the questions.

Collapsing the two into one mark makes a 100%-errored run indistinguishable
from a model that honestly scored zero.
