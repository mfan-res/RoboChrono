"""Run identity: which experiment a set of results belongs to.

A result file that does not say which experiment produced it is a trap that
springs later: rerun with changed parameters, and question-level resume will
happily extend the old file, leaving half the rows under one configuration and
half under another, with nothing recording the seam.

The identity is a directory name::

    results/2026-08-27_a1b2c3d4e5f6/
            └── created ──┘└─ config fingerprint

The two parts carry two separate jobs. The date is for humans sorting
directories; it is fixed when the directory is first created and never moves.
Equality is judged by the fingerprint alone — which is why resuming after an
interruption works: the same command produces the same fingerprint, the
existing directory is found by suffix, and work continues. A current-timestamp
name would send every rerun to a fresh empty directory.

The fingerprint covers **exactly the things that change results**: the
protocol, the suite, the dataset fingerprint, the participating models'
configuration files, and the code version. It deliberately excludes anything
that varies by machine — concurrency, proxies, cache paths, GPU counts —
because two runs differing only in those are the same experiment.

Configuration files are hashed as raw bytes. A stricter rule than "the parsed
values changed", and chosen on purpose: deciding which edits are harmless
would need a maintained list of which bytes count, and the cost of being
strict is only an extra directory.
