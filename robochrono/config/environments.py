"""Reading ``configs/environments.json`` — which Python environment each model needs.

More than one environment is required, and this is an upstream constraint rather
than a preference: some model families only load under transformers 4.x, others
only under 5.x, and the two requirements are mutually exclusive.

This module imports no inference libraries. The orchestrator must be able to
start from any environment and dispatch each model to the interpreter it needs;
``tests/test_orchestrator_is_light.py`` enforces that.
