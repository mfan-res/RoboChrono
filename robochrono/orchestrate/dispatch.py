"""Starting each model under the interpreter its environment declares.

No single environment runs every model — the transformers requirements are
mutually exclusive — so the matrix cannot finish inside one interpreter. The
split is **per model**: the matrix is model-major anyway, so cutting it by
model disturbs nothing, and a broken environment or a crashed process takes
down only its own group.

The parent establishes the run directory before dispatching and passes it
down; a child that recomputed identity from its own subset of models would
derive a different fingerprint and file its results elsewhere.

Interpreter paths are joined lexically, **never resolved**: a venv's
``bin/python`` is a symlink to the base interpreter, and resolving it points
``sys.prefix`` at the base environment — the venv's packages silently stop
applying. (``multiprocessing.set_executable`` is avoided for the same family
of reasons: cross-interpreter spawn couples both sides' pickle protocols;
a plain subprocess is boring and reliable.)
