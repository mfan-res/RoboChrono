"""Rendering a question from the ids it stores.

A question file records which action a question is about, not the sentence that
describes it. Everything needed to turn one into the other sits beside it:

    qa/subtasks.json    scenario -> its actions: id, description
    qa/scenarios.json   scenario -> what it is doing overall
    qa/dimensions.json  dimension -> how it words its question

The reason for storing ids is not brevity. Spelling the description out
would copy it into the stem, into the options array, and again into whichever
option is correct — several copies per question across the whole dataset. Any
rewording would then have to hit every copy, and a missed one would leave a
dataset that still loads, still scores, and disagrees with itself. Storing the
id makes that unrepresentable.

Action ids are unique within a scenario, not across the dataset — two
scenarios that both pick up a pen both call it ``pick_pen``. Every question
names only actions from its own scenario, so lookups here are scoped to the
question's scenario. The scoping is also a check: a question that referenced
another scenario's action would fail loudly instead of silently borrowing
whatever text a global table happened to hold.

The reason all three files live inside ``qa/`` is that a question bank has to
be readable on its own. The manifest fingerprint answers "is this the same set
of questions", and it hashes questions as they are asked, so it has to be
computable from the dataset alone.
